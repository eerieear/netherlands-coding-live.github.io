## About

This event is an open meetup of the live coding community in Eindhoven. The event is an informal yet informative open session anyone from the public is very welcome to participate, you do not need to have previous experience in live coding or programming. Everyone is free to present live-coding related work.The idea is to share, learn and get inspired in dialogue. There will also be a "from-scratch" session. Where everyone gets a change to start from zero and make a piece of music and or visuals in 9 minutes. There will be an Mercury workshop earlier on in the day time T.B.A.

This session is organised by Wilbert Vogel a.k.a. Lil Bleep.
