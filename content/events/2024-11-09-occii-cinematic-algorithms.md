## About

A night of electronic music and visuals combining live coding, concrete sounds, synthesis, analog electronics, computer generated graphics, generative music, and more! All deeply rooted in improvisation. Presented in collaboration between OCCII and Netherlands Coding Live (NL_CL).

## Line-up

#### \unexCoder
\unexCoder is a composer and computer artist from Argentina. He uses programming languages to develop and build hybrid performance systems that combine live coded algorithms with analog devices and computer generated graphics. His audiovisual pieces push the viewer into a deep abstract volumetric aural and visual experience. He has performed in festivals and concerts in Argentina, Spain, Germany, France and Netherlands.

#### eerie_ear
eerie_ear/ Sebastian Pappalardo is a sound designer and digital artist. His multimedia project eerie_ear explores audio visual generative art, using live coded interactivity to create sound and pixel synthesis, audio signal and sample processing through a prism of multiplicity, feedback, geometry, glitch-art and noise manipulation.

Motivated to contribute to the creation of a more holistic approach in the arts and technology landscape, he focuses his music and video production process on the concept of “systems of growth”. In a passionate and mindful conversation with generative algorithms, his art evolves in haphazard rhythms and intervals, inspired by timbres and tensions present in abstract art, contemporary composition and cinematic sound design. He produces challenging and intricate acousmatic sonorities, some such experiments combine granular synthesis tidalcycles functions with dreamy midi devices, to create complex multi-instrument sound textures and patterns.

Sebastian is also an AV professional, specialized in film sound post-production, and an educator, focusing on media in the context of socio-cultural environments and the relation between the audiovisual and educational processes.

#### Saskia Freeke
Saskia Freeke creates generative, computational art on a daily basis. Both her works and her practice stand out by their distinctive playful characteristic. By creating her own rules and playfully adapting these as she goes, Saskia applies a notable evolving narrative to her work. The act of live coding provides an awesome complementary context to her discourse – for it is the realtime exercise amongst and in conjunction with creative peers that make her contemporary artistic principles come into full play.

#### Sonologico
Sonologico (Raphael Sousa Santos) is a composer, visual artist and programmer from the Northeast of Brazil based in the Netherlands. Using sounds from traditional instruments, synthesizers, recordings, and audio processing, he uses keyboard instruments, his own programs and live-coding to build soundscapes that range from ethereal still harmonies to distorted pulsating noise.

As a composer, his music has been performed in concerts throughout Brazil. As a performer (both solo and as part of an ensemble), he has performed audiovisual electronic pieces in independent concerts and in events and locations such as the GOGBOT festival, the Oude Muziek Utrecht festival, WORM, and the Orgelpark. He has also performed and produced visual pieces and projections in collaboration with musicians or presented in fixed media.
