## About

Join us for an open stage from-scratch live coding session on a (fingers-crossed) beautiful saturday afternoon in the office space of Creative Coding Utrecht in the Boomtoren at 't Hof van Cartesius. This event is organised partially because earlier that week the [NIME](https://www.nime2024.org/) (New Interfaces for Musical Expression) Conference is held in Utrecht. If you like to attend any or some of the NIME concerts you can better buy a ticket through the [Gaudeamus Festival](https://gaudeamus.nl/programma-festival/).

If you like to participate in the from-scratch session, please feel free to [send us an e-mail](mailto:netherlandscodinglive@protonmail.com?subject=NL_CL%20From-Scratch%20Sign-Up)! Or come to the event with your laptop and let us know on the spot.

**The from-scratch rules:**

- Live code for **9 minutes** *(no more, no less)*
- Use the language of your choosing
- Start with an empty code editor
- Program music or visuals *(or something else if you have crazy ideas!)*
- The audience always claps at the end
- The line-up is decided (psuedo-)randomly at the beginning of the event
